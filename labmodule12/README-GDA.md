# Gateway Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 12 - Semester Project - GDA Components

### Description
In Lab Module 12, the Gateway Device Application (GDA) securely connects Cloud Data Analytics (CDA) with cloud services, handling data processing, storage, and actuation event generation. It encrypts data transmission, processes system and sensor data from the CDA, and sends this data to the cloud. The GDA also generates unique actuation events based on custom algorithms and monitors its internal performance metrics. Designed for continuous operation, it ensures data integrity and responsiveness to cloud-based triggers, supported by comprehensive testing for reliability.
