# Cloud Service Functions (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 12 - Semester Project - CSF Components

### Description

In my Lab Module 12 project, I've chosen Ubidots as the cloud service provider, thanks to its robust IoT capabilities and support for secure user authentication, authorization, and encryption through TLS. Building on the framework established in Lab Module 11, my first task is to ensure a secure encrypted connection between Ubidots and the Gateway Device Application (GDA). The main focus of my project is to collect, store, and visualize sensor and system performance data from the GDA. I'll be using Ubidots' visualization tools to display at least 30 samples for each variable over a minimum duration of one hour.

Additionally, I am tasked with developing a new feature within Ubidots. This involves creating a unique function or algorithm that triggers an actuation event under specific conditions, which is different from the events generated by the GDA or Cloud Data Analytics (CDA). This element adds a new layer of complexity compared to the basic actuation event I developed in Lab Module 11. Lastly, I will capture screenshots of my data visualizations in Ubidots to include in my project documentation. These visualizations will showcase how effectively I have managed and represented the collected data within my IoT ecosystem.
